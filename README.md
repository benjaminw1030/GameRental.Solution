As a patron, I want to see a history of all the books I checked out, so that I can look up the name of that awesome sci-fi novel I read three years ago. (Hint: make a checkouts table that is a join table between patrons and copies.)



As a patron, I want to know when a book I checked out is due, so that I know when to return it.
As a librarian, I want to see a list of overdue books, so that I can call up the patron who checked them out and tell them to bring them back - OR ELSE!
